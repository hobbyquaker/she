# Backlog

Items that are intentionally deferred. Pick up when the time is right.

## Git Integration



## AI 

- **AI-generated auto-commit messages** — when auto-commit is enabled and a script is saved (or renamed/deleted), instead of the generic `"update <path>"` message, ask the configured AI to generate a meaningful commit message based on the diff (`git diff --cached`). Should be best-effort: fall back to the generic message if the AI call fails or times out. Needs a budget-conscious prompt (diff only, no extra context) and a short timeout so saves don't feel sluggish.

## Script Engine

- **`import` syntax support** — scripts currently run via `vm.Script` (classic-script context) which rejects static `import` declarations. Transform `import X from 'y'` → `const X = require('y')`, `import { a, b } from 'y'` → `const { a, b } = require('y')`, `import * as ns from 'y'` → `const ns = require('y')`, `import 'y'` → `require('y')` inside `createScript()` before handing source to `vm.Script`. Both `import` and `require` would then work side-by-side — no breaking changes. `export` statements have no meaning in script context and should either be stripped silently or cause a clear error. Do not support `import.meta` or top-level `await` (both require true ESM module scope). Implementation: ~30 lines, no new deps. A minimal regex approach covers 99% of real-world use; for robustness consider using acorn (transitive dep) to find and rewrite only top-level import nodes.

- **per-script resource limits** — detect callbacks that take too long, log a warning

- **per-script log history** — when a script crashes at 3am and the user opens the UI, the circular log buffer may have rotated away the relevant entries. Concrete symptom: the file tree shows a red error dot on the script, but clicking it opens an empty log panel — the error that caused the dot is gone. Store the last N log lines per script persistently in the data dir (e.g. `~/.she/logs/<scriptname>.jsonl`, ring-buffered) so the log panel always shows recent history even after daemon restart or log rotation.

- **script VM timeout** — the `vm.Script` `timeout` option is never set; a script with an infinite synchronous loop hangs the daemon. Add a configurable per-script CPU timeout (e.g. `she.schedule` should not hang the event loop).

- **config hot-reload** — settings like log level, latitude/longitude, influx/elastic endpoints could be reloaded from `config.json` without a full daemon restart (via `SIGHUP` or a `POST /she/config/reload` endpoint).

- **graceful WebSocket shutdown** — when `process.exit(0)` is called (e.g. on restart request), connected WebSocket clients drop abruptly. Send a WS close frame first so the frontend can show a meaningful disconnect message.

## Scripts Editor

- **Find & Replace entry point** — add a small **Edit** menu button in the editor toolbar, positioned between the `filename` span and the git-status badges (current layout left-to-right: `filename | [Edit▾] | git-status | Save | Delete | AI`). Clicking it opens a compact dropdown with at minimum: *Find* (`Ctrl+F`) and *Find & Replace* (`Ctrl+H`). Could also include *Go to line* (`Ctrl+G`). Each item calls `editor.getAction('<id>')?.run()` on the Monaco instance. No Monaco context-menu changes; no new route. Frontend-only, ~20 lines + dropdown styling.

- **Find in files** — cross-file text search across all files in the scripts directory. Backend: new endpoint `GET /she/scripts/search?q=<text>&regex=false&caseSensitive=false`; reads all non-binary files via the existing storage layer, scans line-by-line, returns `[{ path, matches: [{ line, col, preview }] }]` (line 1-based, preview is the matched line trimmed); caps total matches at ~500 and sets a `truncated` flag. Frontend: a search-icon button in the sidebar toolbar (next to `+ File`, `+ Folder`) toggles a search panel that slides in above the file tree; fields: text input + `Aa` case toggle + `.*` regex toggle + debounced search-on-type (300 ms); results grouped by file showing matched lines with the match highlighted; clicking a result opens the tab and jumps via `editor.revealLineInCenter()` + `editor.setPosition()`; shows total result / file counts and a truncation notice when capped. Searches all file types the editor handles (excluding detected binary files — skip files containing a null byte in the first 8 KB). Keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+F` should open the panel regardless of whether Monaco has focus: register the shortcut both via `editor.addCommand` (inside Monaco) and as a `keydown` listener on the Svelte layout container (outside Monaco).

- **Find and replace across files** — extend the find-in-files panel with an optional replace field (toggle-disclosed, VS Code style). Confirmation step before applying: show a preview list of all changes grouped by file with diff-style before/after lines and a per-file checkbox to opt out. Applies changes via sequential `PUT /she/scripts/:path` calls. Undo is out of scope for v1 — the confirmation step is the safeguard. Depends on *Find in files* being shipped first.

- **Find in files — auto-refresh on save** — after a script is saved (tab `dirty → clean` transition or external WS `script:change` event), re-run the current search query silently and update the result list in-place, highlighting newly appeared or disappeared matches. Should debounce file-change events (files can save in quick succession). Depends on *Find in files* being shipped first.

- **tab bar scrolling** — when many files are open the tab bar overflows with no way to reach hidden tabs (the bar already has `overflow-x: auto; scrollbar-width: none` so the overflow exists but is invisible). Fix: wrap the tab strip in a `tab-bar-wrap` flex row containing a `‹` button, the tab strip (`flex:1`, `overflow-x: hidden`), and a `›` button; clicking either calls `tabBarEl.scrollBy({ left: ±200, behavior: 'smooth' })`; a `wheel` listener on the strip translates `deltaY` → `scrollLeft` (with `e.preventDefault()` to suppress page scroll). Buttons are always rendered but disabled/dimmed (opacity ~0.3, `cursor: default`) at the respective end — avoids layout shift and `ResizeObserver` complexity. Track `canScrollLeft` / `canScrollRight` from a combined `scroll` + `ResizeObserver` listener on the strip. Bonus: call `activeTabEl.scrollIntoView({ inline: 'nearest' })` on every tab switch so the active tab is always visible. Frontend-only, no backend changes.

- **file tree virtualization** — the tree re-renders entirely on any change; with hundreds of scripts this becomes slow. Use a virtual list (`svelte-virtual-list` or similar) to only render visible rows.

## MQTT

- **per-topic value history** — the MQTT tab shows current state only. A configurable ring buffer (e.g. last 20 values with timestamps) per topic would be useful for debugging value changes over time.

- **multiple MQTT broker connections** — allow connecting to more than one broker simultaneously. Config: replace the top-level `url` string with a `brokers` map where each key is a broker name and the value is the existing per-broker options object (`url`, `username`, `password`, `ca`, `cert`, `key`, `mqttVersion`). The existing `url` key stays supported as shorthand for a single default broker (backward compat). Script API: `she.broker(name)` returns a broker-scoped object exposing the full `mqtt` sub-API (`sub`, `pub`, `get`, `link`, `or`, `and`, `max`, `min`, `timer`, `age`, `getProp`). `she.mqtt` remains a shorthand alias for `she.broker('default')` (or the sole configured broker). State store keys become `mqtt::brokerName::topic`. WS `mqtt` events carry an additional `broker` field. Each broker runs its own sentinel cycle on connect. `link()` and the stdlib helpers (`or`, `and`, `max`, `min`, `timer`) work within a single broker scope only in this first step — cross-broker bridging is a follow-up. Breaking change — requires a migration note when shipped.

  **Config page UX** — the broker configuration section uses a file-tab-style switcher (same visual language as the editor's script tabs) sitting above the broker form panel. One tab per configured broker; clicking a tab activates that broker's form. Each tab shows the broker name and a small status dot (green/yellow/red, same `nav-dot` classes). A `+` button at the right end of the tab bar adds a new broker with a generated name and empty fields. Each tab has a `×` delete button (with confirmation). The form fields are: *name* (editable — renaming updates the tab label and the `brokers` map key), *url*, *username*, *password* (masked, with show/hide toggle), *ca*, *cert*, *key*, *mqttVersion*, *sentinelTimeout*. When only one broker is configured the tab bar is still shown (consistent UX, and makes it obvious how to add a second one). The existing single-broker fields (`url`, `mqttUsername`, …) in the form are migrated to the `brokers` map on first save.

  **MQTT page UX** — when multiple brokers are configured, a broker filter tab bar appears above the topic list (styled like the Config broker tabs, "All" selected by default). Selecting a broker tab filters the list to that broker's topics only; the "All" tab shows every topic from every broker. In the "All" view each row shows a small broker badge (the broker name in a muted chip, similar to `pane-count`) so the origin is visible at a glance; badges are hidden when only one broker is configured or a single broker tab is active. The publish form gains a broker selector dropdown (defaults to the first/only broker; hidden when only one broker exists). The nav dot on the MQTT tab reflects the worst-case state across all brokers: red if any broker is configured but disconnected, yellow/blinking if any broker is still waiting for the sentinel, green only when all brokers are fully ready. The dot's tooltip lists per-broker status.

  *Optional follow-up — cross-broker references:* allow `'brokerName##topic'` as a topic string in `link()` and stdlib helpers to reference a topic on a different broker. `##` is chosen as separator because a double hash can never appear in a valid MQTT topic (the `#` wildcard is only legal as a standalone final segment and publishing to a topic containing `#` is forbidden by spec), making it unambiguous to parse.

## sheDB



## Secrets

- **secrets management** — store secrets (named groups of arbitrary string fields, e.g. `{ "smtp": { "password": "…", "host": "…" } }`) in a dedicated encrypted file (`~/.she/secrets.enc`) separate from `config.json`, using AES-256-GCM via Node.js built-in `crypto`. Encryption key sourced from env var `SHE_SECRETS_KEY` (takes precedence) or key file `~/.she/secrets.key` (chmod 600). Access from scripts via `she.secrets.get('<name>/<field>')`. Integrate as own section in config ui (show/hide values). Open questions to resolve before implementation: HTTP API exposure (security concern — avoid reading secret values over the network, or localhost-only), behavior when key is missing, hot-reload vs. startup-only, CLI subcommands for management, configurable secrets file path.

## Operations

- **health check endpoint** — `GET /she/health` returning 200 if the daemon is alive, configured mqtt broker is connected, ..., 503 otherwise. Useful for Docker health checks, nginx upstreams, and monitoring systems.


## Security / Robustness

- **path traversal via symlinks** — `safePath()` in `scripts-api.js` checks `startsWith(root + sep)` but does not resolve symlinks. A symlinked entry inside the script root could point outside it. Use `fs.realpath()` to resolve before checking.

- **session persistence** — login sessions are held in-memory and lost on every daemon restart, forcing all users to re-login. Persist session tokens (hashed) to a file in `--data-dir`.

## Testing

- **integration tests for `.shelib` / `.shedisable` marker hot-reload** — the live unload/reload on marker changes has no test coverage.

- **integration tests for rapid hot-reload** — edge cases in subscription cleanup during rapid script updates (change → reload cycle) are not tested.
